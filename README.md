# Project Overview

This project involves the application of three Machine Learning (ML) methods across five datasets. For each dataset, all three ML methods were developed, tested, and evaluated. The following files are provided for each dataset:

- **Code**: Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for running the ML models.
- **Reports**: XML files that contain detailed reports of the model performance.

## How to Use

### 1. Accessing Data Files:
   - **OneDrive Link**: The extracted CSV files required for running the code are available on [OneDrive](https://atlantictu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/l00179090_atu_ie/Ev35_2otjnJJtZCBh5JK47wBr6hZILMrKArTp5xqqX2uqA?e=t072Yz). These files have been pre-processed from the original datasets and can be directly downloaded to use with the provided code.
   - **Direct Download**: Downloading these files from OneDrive will save time compared to extracting the raw data from the OSF repository [this OSF repository](https://osf.io/d45bw/).

### 2. Viewing the Code and Reports:
   - You can directly view the code and XML reports within this repository.
   - The reports provide an overview of model performance, including metrics and visualizations.

### 3. Running the Code Locally:
   - **Download the Code**: Download the relevant files from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/HonneshMuppala/projectMLcode) to execute the ML methods on your local machine.
   - **Install Necessary Packages**: Install all required packages and libraries using the provided info.
   - **Execution Order**: To replicate the results, execute the ML methods in the provided order after setting up your environment.
   - 
This setup allows users to view results online or replicate the experiment locally for further analysis.
