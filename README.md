# Project Overview

This project involves the application of three Machine Learning (ML) methods across five datasets. For each dataset, all three ML methods were developed, tested, and evaluated. The following files are provided for each dataset:

- **Code**: Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for running the ML models.
- **Reports**: XML files that contain detailed reports of the model performance.

## How to Use

1. **View the Code and Reports**: 
   - You can directly view the code and XML reports within this repository.
   - The reports provide an overview of model performance, including metrics and visualizations.

2. **Run the Code**:
   - Download the relevant files from this repository.
   - Open the files in VS Code or any other Python-supported environment.
   - Install the necessary packages and libraries (requirements.txt is provided) to run the code successfully.
